<p style="margin:10px;">       <b>     When it comes to photography, few destinations in the world can equal the rich mix of opportunities that can be enjoyed in India. From its colorful street scenes with their numerous festivals and temples to its many majestic old palaces and fortresses, this dynamic country has more than found its mojo in recent decades.

<br>A nation of deep contrasts, where the modern coincides with the traditions of the past, India is one of those destinations that's perfect for those who enjoy slow travel. Take your time and savor – and photograph, of course – everything this incredible country has to offer.

<h3  class="mx-3 mx-3 " ><i>TYPES OF SERVICES OFFERED BY TRAVEL AGENCIES</i></h3>
<br>
  <div  class="mx-3 mx-3 ">
    <div>
      <p>Although travel agencies have not been spared by technological advancements and have been forced to evolve as travelers become more demanding and better informed, they have always been a means of consultation. Travel matters; whether through the Internet, telephone, social networks, or physically, the services and products they make available to the customer remain virtually the same from their inception.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4><u><h4>HOUSING</h4></u></h4>
    
    <p>It is the place where a person stays during their travels. And it serves as a shelter, home, roof, and/or rest area. You can find hotels, motels, inns, camps, condominiums, timeshares, and private residences within this service.</p>
    
    <br>
    <h4><u><h4>TRANSPORT</h4></u></h4>
    
    <p>If you are going to places close to your place of origin, you will likely rent a bus or car or need a boat or cruise to travel by sea. And for example, looking to get between two continents, you may need the means of transport the airplane. A travel agency can provide all types of transport, whether sea, air, rail, or land.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><u><h4>FOOD</h4></u></h4>
    
    <p>Food may be included in the accommodation. Otherwise, travel agencies may come into contact with restaurants, and it will be up to them to recommend the ideal place to the traveler. Included in these are breakfasts, lunches, dinners (according to different plans), lunches, or coffee breaks.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><u><h4>TOURIST ROUTES</h4></u></h4>
    
    <p>The combination and interconnection of geographically separate destinations constitute a unique offer of tourism services when grouped together. These are excursions organized in different cities with regular departures that facilitate the preparation of itineraries for travelers. A tourist circuit begins and ends at the same place and does not cross the same place twice.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><u><h4>CRUISE SERVICE</h4></u></h4>
    
    <p>In itself, this is a kind of tourist package. These are sea trips, normally in a territorial area (several countries), aboard a cruise with all the services necessary to stay there (accommodation, catering, and attractions). During the tour, you will stay in the ports of the visited tourist destination for a while so that the traveler has the opportunity to get off and find out if it’s convenient for you.</p>
